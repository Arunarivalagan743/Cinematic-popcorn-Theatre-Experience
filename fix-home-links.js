// fix-home-links.js - Script to explain the fix for booking links in Home.jsx

/* 
This script documents the fix we made to the Home.jsx component to address the "Movie not found" error.

The problem:
1. The booking links in Home.jsx were not handling showtime references correctly
2. In some cases, showtimes were stored as references (ObjectIds) rather than populated objects
3. This caused the booking system to fail when trying to access properties like ._id on a non-object

The fix:
1. Updated the condition to check both cases: 
   - When showtimes[0] is an object (populated) with _id property 
   - When showtimes[0] is just a reference (string/ObjectId)

2. The updated code includes this check:
   {movie.showtimes && movie.showtimes.length > 0 && movie.showtimes[0] && 
    (typeof movie.showtimes[0] === 'object' ? movie.showtimes[0]._id : movie.showtimes[0]) ? (
      <Link to={`/tickets/${movie._id}/${typeof movie.showtimes[0] === 'object' ? 
        movie.showtimes[0]._id : movie.showtimes[0]}`}>
        ...
      </Link>
    ) : (
      ...
    )}

This ensures that regardless of whether the API returns populated showtime objects or just references,
the booking links will be generated correctly.

Additional steps taken:
1. Created and ran fix-associations.js to ensure proper relationships between movies and showtimes
2. Created and ran fix-movies.js to create showtimes for any movies missing them
3. Created check-database.js to verify the database state

The system now correctly:
1. Displays real-time booking buttons for movies that have showtimes
2. Shows fallback legacy booking buttons for movies without showtimes
3. Properly handles both object references and populated objects in the showtime array
